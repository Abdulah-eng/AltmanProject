# Success Stories Management System

This document explains how to use the success stories management system for displaying testimonials on the training page.

## Overview

The success stories management system allows you to add, edit, and manage testimonials and success stories through the admin dashboard. Success stories are displayed on the training page (`/training`) in beautiful card layouts with profile images and quotes.

## Database Schema

The `success_stories` table includes the following fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `name`: Person's name
- `title`: Job title or position
- `quote`: Testimonial quote
- `image_url`: Profile image URL (optional)
- `featured`: Boolean flag for featured stories
- `order_index`: Display order (lower numbers appear first)
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `updated_at`: Timestamp

## Using the Admin Dashboard

### Accessing Success Stories Management
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Click on the "Success Stories" tab
3. You'll see all success stories and an "Add Success Story" button

### Adding a New Success Story
1. Click "Add Success Story" button
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Profile Image**: Upload a profile image (required for new stories)
   - **Name**: Person's full name
   - **Title/Position**: Job title or specialty
   - **Quote/Testimonial**: Their success story quote
   - **Display Order**: Number for ordering (lower = first)

## Display Locations

### Training Page (`/training`)
- Shows all success stories in the "SUCCESS STORIES" section
- Each story displays:
  - Profile image (if available)
  - Name and title
  - Quote in italics
  - Professional card layout

## Database Setup

Run the following SQL to create the success stories table:

```sql
-- Run the script: scripts/create-success-stories-table.sql
```

This will:
- Create the `success_stories` table with all required fields
- Add indexes for better performance
- Create an `updated_at` trigger
- Insert three sample success stories

## Using Success Stories in Components

### Fetching All Success Stories

```typescript
import { getSuccessStories } from "@/lib/success-stories-utils"

// In your component
const [successStories, setSuccessStories] = useState([])

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchStories = async () => {
    const allStories = await getSuccessStories()
    setSuccessStories(allStories)
  }
  fetchStories()
}, [])
```

### Fetching Featured Success Stories

```typescript
import { getFeaturedSuccessStories } from "@/lib/success-stories-utils"

// Get only featured stories
const featuredStories = await getFeaturedSuccessStories()
```

## File Structure

```
components/admin/
  success-stories-manager.tsx  # Admin dashboard success stories manager
lib/
  success-stories-utils.ts     # Utility functions for success stories management
scripts/
  create-success-stories-table.sql # Database creation script
  test-success-stories.sql     # Test script for verification
app/
  training/page.tsx            # Training page with success stories display
```

## Example Success Story Data

Here's an example of the success story data structure:

```typescript
{
  id: "uuid-here",
  name: "Sarah Johnson",
  title: "Beverly Hills Agent",
  quote: "The training program transformed my approach to luxury real estate. I've tripled my sales volume in just 6 months.",
  image_url: "https://example.com/sarah-profile.jpg",
  featured: true,
  order_index: 1,
  created_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  updated_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```
